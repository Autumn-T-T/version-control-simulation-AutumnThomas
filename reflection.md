or this project, I started by setting up my GitHub repository and cloning it to my computer. From there, I created a branch called feature/header to work on the header section of the page. I added a simple header to index.html and committed those changes. Then I switched back to main and created another branch called feature/footer to work on the footer. I added the footer content and committed it as well.

Next, I switched back to feature/header and modified the footer in a slightly different way so that it would conflict with the footer from feature/footer. This set up the merge conflict I needed to practice resolving. After switching to main, I merged the feature/footer branch first, which went smoothly. Then, when I tried to merge feature/header, Git showed a merge conflict in index.html. I opened the file and saw the conflict markers. I decided which changes to keep, combined them into a single clean version, removed the conflict markers, and then committed the resolved file.

Finally, I pushed my changes to GitHub and created a pull request from main into a new branch called review/main. I had to make a tiny additional change in index.html to create a visible difference so that GitHub would allow the pull request to be created. Submitting the PR helped me understand how code is reviewed and tracked in a collaborative environment, and seeing the differences between branches made the process feel very real.

Overall, this project gave me hands-on experience with creating and switching branches, committing changes, handling merge conflicts, and submitting pull requests. It showed me how version control works in a practical way and why it’s important for collaboration and code management. I feel more confident using Git and GitHub after completing this assignment.
